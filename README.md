# alimonia 🥦

alimonia is an native Android and iOS app with which you can create personalized weekly nutrition plans and organize your food purchases.

You can add your meals to the app and then use them in a calendar-like view to create weekly nutrition plans.

You can also add nutritional information to your recipes to monitor their caloric intake throughout the week.

Integration with the Apple Health and Google Fit apps is planned!
